# Life
Linked project with JVM and libraries got a bit sizable, and so zip file was larger than git allows.

Therefore, it was moved to google drive:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eCsSpbiC1-szZKBb9OtC27q1o09nfWY9/view?usp=sharing

How to easily run on Linux/Mac:
1. Download Life.zip (Google drive)
2. Extract and go to Life/bin
3. Run Life.sh

How to run on Windows (most likely):
1. open Maven project from pom.xml and provide all needed libraries
2. run App class
